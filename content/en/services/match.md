#       content: "Our mobile and web apps work together with machine learning to create ISAIAH. Match is one of the 'skills' of ISAIAH. If our proposed social system is based on Socrates, our governence system is based on David Hume, and our economic system is based on Adam Smith, our proposed personality system is based on Spinoza's Ethics which proposes predestination that checks liberalism. A hamburger lover would think that he is eating hamburgers out of his free will. But metaphysically, his love for burgers is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandha_(Jainism)'>predetermined bondage</a> arising from a quality of his soul, which can then be revealed by data. This then would support the belief that we exist inside a matrix that the Hindus call the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma'>Brahma</a>"
