Privacy Policy for Superphysics Match

Last Updated: November 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Match ("the App") handles the information you provide within the application.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your data is managed. The most critical point of this policy is: your personal data is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to us, our servers, or any third party.

1. Data Storage Model (Local Only)

The App is designed to operate without any server-side components for user data storage or processing.

Local Storage: All personal information, profile details, and personality data you enter into the App are stored solely using the device’s local storage features.

No Transmission: We do not collect, send, transmit, or otherwise share any of this personal data off your device. The data never leaves your phone or tablet.

2. Information Stored on Your Device

The only information we store is the data you explicitly enter to build your personality profile, which may include:

Profile Information: Your name, nickname, or chosen identifier.

Personality Input: Your answers to questions, choices, or input fields used by the App to generate your personality profile.

Generated Profile: The resulting personality traits, analysis, and statistics calculated by the App’s internal algorithms.

This information remains entirely local to your device.

3. How We Use the Local Information

The local information is used exclusively for the following purposes within the App:

Profile Generation: To process your input and generate your personality profile.

Internal Display: To display your personality profile to you, and to others who may be viewing the App on your device, as intended by the application's core feature.

App Customization: To remember your settings and preferences locally.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure (None)

Since your data is stored locally on your device, we do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any of your personal information to any third parties, including advertisers, analytical services, or other entities.

5. Security of Your Data

Because the data is stored locally, the security of your information is largely determined by the security of your mobile device:

Device Security: We encourage you to secure your own device.

Data Deletion: If you uninstall the App or clear its local storage cache, the data stored on your device will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered by us or anyone else.

6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly process any data from children under 13, and since we do not collect data on a server, we have no means of verification. If you are under 13, please do not use this App.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
