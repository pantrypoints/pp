Pantrypoints City is the public, base platform for points-transactions between users as mutual customers of each other. 

This is different from the other Pantry Platforms where transactions are of a hierachal-level such as boss-employee or customer-supplier.


## Intent

Pantrypoints City is for generating blue collar or freelance employment (giving and finding work) by facilitating a moneyless points system. This is because City facilitates same-level transactions. 

White collar and regular jobs are facilitated by the private Pantrypreneurplatforms such as Educate, Rewards, and Farm.
