<!-- Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is a cross-disciplinary area concerned with protecting the safety, health and welfare of people engaged in work or employment. Knowing OHS is essential to minimize the hazards and risks not only to students, trainers and other people within the training institution but others who will be affected. -->


Occupational safety and health is a discipline with aims to protect every worker against the dangers of injury, sickness or death through safe and healthful working conditions (OSHC-DOLE, 2016).

<!-- , thereby assuring the conservation of valuable manpower resources and the prevention of loss or damage to lives and properties, consistent with national development goals and with the state’s commitment for the total development of every worker as a complete human being  -->

It has 3 interdependent concepts:

1. Occupational safety

This is the understanding the causes of accidents at work and ways to prevent unsafe act and unsafe conditions in any workplace.

Safety at work discusses concepts on good housekeeping, proper materials handling and storage, machine safety, electrical safety, fire prevention and control, safety inspection, and accident investigation.


2. Occupational health

A broad concept which explains how the different hazards and risks at work may cause an illness and emphasizes that health programs are essential in controlling work-related and/or occupational diseases.


3. Industrial hygiene

The identification, evaluation, and control of physical, chemical, biological and ergonomic hazards.



## Focus of OSH

- the promotion and maintenance of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations 
- the prevention of adverse health effects of the working conditions
- the placing and maintenance of workers in an occupational environment adapted to physical and mental needs
- the adaptation of work to humans (and NOT the other way around).

These require the collaboration and participation of both employers and workers in health and safety programs, and involves issues on:
- occupational medicine
- industrial hygiene
- toxicology
- education
- engineering safety
- ergonomics
- psychology, etc.



## Concept of Safety

<!-- Safety and Accident -->

Industrial hygiene promotes safety to the highest level and eliminates or minimizes accidents in the workplace.

<!-- There people who possessed the experience and the expertise in identifying the possible sources and processes of accidents; and planning to set up a system that will address safety issues before accidents happen.  -->

Safety is protection against physical, social, spiritual, financial, political, emotional, occupational, psychological, educational or other types or consequences of failure, damage, error, accidents, harm.

 <!-- or any other event which could be considered non-desirable. This can take the form of being protected from the event or from exposure to something that causes health or economical losses. It can include protection of people or of possessions. Or in short,  -->

Safety is freedom from accidents.


### Hazards Versus Dangers Versus Risk

Name | Definition | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Hazards | Elements that poses risk or danger | Grease, problematic staff, electricity
Dangers | Situations brought about the presence or combination of hazards | Grease on the floor, problematic staff operating a machine, open electric wire
Risk | A combination of the frequency and the severity of the consequence of a specific accident | Fracture can happen someone stepped on the greasy floor, a limb can be cut off if a problematic staff will operate a machine, electrocution if someone will touch open electric wire
Accident | A result of contact of a body with a source of energy above the threshold limit of the body or structure. It interrupts the normal progress of any activity. This can result to physical harm, damage to property or delay in operation and are related to many factors (see Tab. 4a) | A crew who stepped on the greasy floor, A problematic crew who cut off a limb, Electrocution of a crew due to contact
Incident | An unplanned and unwanted event which disrupts the work process. It has the potential of to injure, harm, or damage persons or property | A 50 lbs. carton falls off the top shelf of a 12’ high rack and lands near a worker.

 

### Causes of Accidents

1. Unsafe acts

Violations of safe procedures could be an act of omission or an act of commission


2. Unsafe Conditions

Seen as a physical or chemical property in the material


### Contributing Factors of an Accident

Equipment | Environment | People/Human Factor | Management
--- | --- | --- | ---
- Equipment failure | - Weather conditions | - Level of experience | - Management support for safety
- Machinery design/guarding | - Housekeeping | - Level of training | - Safety policies
- Hazardous substances | - Temperature | - Physical capability | - Enforcement of safety policies 
- Substandard material | - Lighting | - Health | - Adequate supervision
 | - Air contaminants | - Fatigue | - Knowledge of hazards: corrective action, Preventive maintenance, Regular audits
 | - Personal protective equipment | - Stress
 

## Hazards and Control

### Hazard Prevention and Control

Workplace hazards can be mitigated or prevented by effective design of the job site or job.

 <!-- Where it is not feasible to eliminate such hazards, they must be controlled to prevent unsafe and unhealthful exposure. A plan that will eliminate or control must be put in place in a timely manner once a hazard or potential hazard is recognize (see Tab. 4b). Specifically, as part of the program, -->

Employers should establish procedures to correct or control present or potential hazards in a timely manner. These procedures should include measures such as the following:

- Use engineering techniques where feasible and appropriate.
- Establish, at the earliest time, safe work practices and procedures that are understood and followed by all affected parties. 
- Understanding and compliance are a result of training, positive reinforcement, correction of unsafe performance, and if necessary, enforcement through a clearly communicated disciplinary system.
- Provide personal protective equipment when engineering controls are infeasible.
- Use administrative controls, such as reducing the duration of exposure.
- Maintain the facility and equipment to prevent equipment breakdowns.
- Plan and prepare for emergencies, and conduct training and emergency drills, as needed, to ensure that proper responses to emergencies will be "second nature" for all persons involved.
- Establish a medical program that includes first aid onsite as well as nearby physician and emergency medical care to reduce the risk of any injury or illness that occurs.
 

### Table 4b. Different Types of Hazards

Physical Hazards | Chemical Hazards | Biologic Hazards | Ergonomic Hazards
Noise | Liquids, Solids, Gas | Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi, Insects/Parasites |  Improper tools and equipment design
Vibration | Route of entry (Inhalation, Ingestion, Injection, Skin, Eye Contamination) | | Unnecessary and unusual design
Illumination | | Repetitive Motions
Temperatures | | Stress at work
Air
Pressure
 

## Hierarchy of Hazard Controls

The occurrence of accidents or incidents can be prevented or mitigated by addressing its root cause - hazards in the workplace.

1. Elimination

This totally eliminates the hazard from the workplace.

This should be the top priority for all safety professionals including industrial hygienists. 

An example is replacing a hazardous chemical with a totally non-toxic, safe, chemical.

2. Substitution

This reduces the hazard with something less hazardous. This should be used if it is not feasible to eliminate the hazard.

There would still be a need for protection like personal protective equipment.

3. Engineering controls

This removes or reduces the hazard through design.

<!-- This strategy involves the design or redesign of tools, equipment, machinery and facilities so that hazardous chemicals are not needed or that exposure to those hazardous chemicals are not possible.  -->

Examples include using equipment that does not require the use of hazardous chemicals in a process or for cleaning. Enclosing work processes or installing general and local ventilation systems might also be used.


4. Warnings

This promotes employee awareness of hazards. 

Warnings are merely visual, audible, and/or tactile indicators that warn people of potential danger. 

<!-- Greater awareness is gained by using signs, alarms, signals, labels, placards, cones, and other methods.  -->

For example, a warning sign might be used to keep workers from entering.


5.  Administrative Controls

This helps reduce exposure by developing and implementing effective training, policies, processes, procedures, practices and safety rules. 

Examples include scheduling production and worker tasks in ways that minimize exposure levels. The employer might schedule operations with the highest exposure potential during periods when the fewest employees are present.


6. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

This is used in conjunction with the other strategies to reduce exposure.

<!-- When effective elimination, substitution and engineering controls are not feasible appropriate PPE such as gloves, safety goggles, helmets, safety shoes, and protective clothing may be required.  -->

To be effective, PPE must be:
- individually selected
- properly fitted
- periodically refitted
- conscientiously and properly worn
- regularly maintained
- replaced as necessary.
