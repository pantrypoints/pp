Every organization are faced with problems or potential problems. It is important to know your role in the process. There are two important things to remember about problems and conflicts: they happen all the time and they are opportunities to improve the system and the relationships. They are actually providing us with information that we can use to fix what needs fixing and do a better job.


## Defining the Problem

These steps will help you clearly identify the root cause of a problem. This process will help you learn how to think deeply about a problem.

Describe the problem, as you currently understand it.

Describe the ideal situation when the problem is resolved

List what you already know and don’t know about the problem. Where can you find out more?

What are the gaps between the reality and ideal situation?

Discuss the problem with your co-workers and brainstorm ideas.

Try to see the problem from the perspective of the people involved and affected.



## Writing a Problem Statement

A problem statement outlines the details of the situation. A clearly described problem statement will help you to focus on the issue at hand and to solve the correct problem for the situation. The problem statement will help you clarify the nature of the problem, for yourself, and for your supervisor and colleagues.

Include as many details as you can as you describe your problem. Answering some basic questions will help you write your problem statement

Who
- is involved?
- is impacted?
- will fix it?

What
- is the current situation?
- will happen if the problem is not addressed?

Where
- is the issue coming from?
Is there a specific part of the machine that is causing a problem?
Is there a specific place in the company where the problem is originating?

When
- does the problem occur?
- did it start?
Are there specific instances that trigger the problem?
By when does the problem need resolution?


Why
- is the problem important to be fixed?


How
- are people impacted by the problem?




## Problem Solving Strategies


A solution addresses your problem.

<!--  It may address the root cause of the problem  or be a workaround that still allows you to complete your task without immediately solving the problem. Ultimately you want to be addressing the root cause of the problem so it doesn’t happen again.
Solutions may involve interim containment measures to stop the immediate problem, corrective actions that address the root cause, and long-term preventative measures to avoid future problems. -->

## 1: Linear Thinking or 5 Whys
 
This is best suited for work and strategy problems. This breaks down a problem until you find its root causes by asking why repeatedly.


## 2: Design Thinking
 
This strategy is best suited for product problems or creative problems. This has the end user in mind.

Step 1. Empathize with the end user.
Step 2. Create testable prototypes for solutions that meet their needs.


## 3: Solutions-Based Thinking
 
This is best suited for big picture problems or urgent problems. 

Focuses on problems (by analyzing, reacting to, and talking about them) to solve them. It sidesteps the often futile search for the causes of problems and heads straight for solutions.



## Planning Solutions

This describes the actions to be taken. 

The plan has enough detail to help you plan your time and track your progress and avoid costly mistakes.


### Elements of Solution Planning 


#### Goals

What are you trying to achieve?
What is the ideal situation once the problem is solved?
You may have more than one. You may have an overall goal and several sub-goals.


#### Steps

·      What tasks need to be completed for each objective?

·      You may have several steps for each. A more complex objective will have more.

·      Think about the sequence of the steps carefully – what needs to be done 1st, 2nd, 3rd?

·      Sometimes tasks can be completed at the same time (one person does one task, while another does another task)


#### Schedule

How much time is needed for each task?
When will it happen?
Be realistic about people’s availability and how much time things will take
 Build in time for obstacles and delays


#### People

Who is responsible for each task?
Who is involved with each task?
Think about people’s job roles and skills so they are doing the tasks that suit them best. (Your supervisor can help with this.)


#### Resources needed

Are there costs involved? Try to estimate any cost information your supervisor will need to know.
Are there materials needed?
Is there any required equipment?
Is transportation needed?
Is storage needed?
Are there printing requirements?


#### Risks

What could go wrong?
What could impact the timeline or results that needs to be considered?
Are there factors outside of your control that need to be accounted for? (Like shipping delays, supplier inventory issues, etc.)


#### Health and Safety

What safety and health considerations need to be taken into account?


#### Environmental Conditions

What environmental rules or protocols should you adhere to while implementing your solution?
How can waste be recycled or disposed of properly?


#### Measuring Success

How will you be able to see that there is progress? What results do you expect to see?
If your results aren’t hitting your expectations, what can you do?
What can the supervisor or others do to help make sure there is progress?
 

#### Reviewing Plan

Are your actions going to help you meet your overall goal?
Are the steps realistic?

Is your plan REAL (Realistic, Effective, Acceptable and Logical)?
