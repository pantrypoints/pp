There are 3 general ways to get Youtube videos:

1. Through Youtube App
2. Through Web-based Downloaders
3. Through Screencast recordings


## Youtube App

This lets you download the video in low or mid quality format, and watch the video offline.

**Pros:**
- No ads or popups

**Cons:**
- You have to connect to the internet every few days.
- If the video or channel is taken down, then **the video also disappears from your app**
  - This is the major disadvantage and is why you have to abandon this method


## Screencast Recordings

You can record the video through screen recorder apps. Just make sure you also record the audio.

**Pros:**
- No ads or popups

**Cons:**
- This requires a large filesize since the recording records each pixel. 


## Web-based Downloaders

Lastly, you can download the video as an MP4 file or audio file through Web-based Downloaders.

**Pros:**
- You save the file on your computer
- You can choose different resolutions or file types

**Cons:**
- Has ads or popups


We recommend web-based downloaders using Linux in order to reduce the risk of viruses.
