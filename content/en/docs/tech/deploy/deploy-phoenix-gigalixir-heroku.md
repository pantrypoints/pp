<!-- We intially developed the Pantry web app using Python Flask and then Ruby on Rails many years ago. 

After we started getting users in our web app, we realized how terrible Flask and Rails were for performance. The users strained our server which we either had to burst (leading to more charges) or restart (which led to a loss of users). 

Flask and Rails clearly had to go. But the dilemma was what to replace them with. Should we go with Golang which was low level? Or should we switch to Phoenix which ran on an efficient virtual machine? 

Since Phoenix is heavily influenced by Rails, we naturally decided to go for Phoenix.  Unlike Flask or Rails that needs a server with minimum 1GB RAM or more, Phoenix can run a full web app with 300 MB! This is in addition to its speed, and its nice LiveView feature, which turns Phoenix into a websocket server.

The easiest way to deploy Phoenix is through Gigalixir or Heroku, so here are the steps for Phoenix 1.6.2, taken from the official guide.  This assumes you already have the Gigalixir and Heroku CLIs and web accounts. Let's say the app name is `socrates`. -->

## Heroku 

1 -- On Heroku Dashboard, create an app named `socrates`

2 -- On Heroku Dashboard, Go to `Settings` -> `Buildpacks` then add 

``` bash
hashnuke/elixir
```
and 

``` bash
https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static.git
```

3 -- In your app's root directory, create the git remote 

``` bash
heroku git:remote -a socrates
```

4 -- In your app's root directory, create the config files

``` bash
$ echo 'elixir_version=1.12.2' > elixir_buildpack.config
$ echo 'erlang_version=24.0.3' >> elixir_buildpack.config
$ echo 'node_version=10.20.1' > phoenix_static_buildpack.config
```

5 -- In your `assets/package.json` (create the file if you don't have it otherwise it won't serve the JS and CSS)

``` bash
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "cd .. && mix assets.deploy && rm -f _build/esbuild"
  }
  ...
}
```

6 -- In your `config/prod.exs`, replace the `url:` line with

``` bash
url: [scheme: "https", host: "socrates.herokuapp.com", port: 443],
force_ssl: [rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto]],
```

7 -- In your `config/runtime.xs` uncomment `ssl: true` 

``` bash
ssl: true
```

8 -- In ` lib/socrates_web/endpoint.ex` add the following in the `socket` line

``` bash
websocket: [timeout: 45_000]
```

9 -- Generate secret key

``` bash
mix phx.gen.secret
```

10 -- Set the resulting key onto Heroku

``` bash
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE="longsecretkey"
```

11 -- Commit to git and push to Heroku

``` bash
git push heroku master
```

12 -- Create database after the app has been deployed

``` bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
heroku config:set POOL_SIZE=10
heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"
heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs"
```

## Gigalixir 

1 -- Create an app through the terminal

``` bash
gigalixir create -n socrates
```

2 -- Create the config files

``` bash
$ echo 'elixir_version=1.10.3' > elixir_buildpack.config
$ echo 'erlang_version=22.3' >> elixir_buildpack.config
$ echo 'node_version=12.16.3' > phoenix_static_buildpack.config
```

3 -- In your `assets/package.json`

``` bash
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "cd .. && mix assets.deploy && rm -f _build/esbuild"
  }
  ...
}
```

4 -- Deploy

``` bash
git push gigalixir 
```

5 -- Create, migrate, and seed the database

``` bash
gigalixir pg:create --free
gigalixir run mix ecto.migrate
gigalixir run mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
```

6 -- To reset the database, go to the Gigilixir dashboard, scale down the app, delete the database, then scale the app back to 1, then do step 5
