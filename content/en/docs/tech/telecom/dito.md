## Get Mobile Advanced Pay Or 5G Wifi Prepaid, Not 4G Wifi Prepaid Nor 5G Wifi Postpaid

It's clear that DITO 4G Wifi has the worst value, and Mobile Advance Pay has the cheapest cost. 


The total cash out for a 2 year 5G Wifi contract is 31,290 pesos or 42.86/day.

The total cash out for 2 years of 5G Wifi Prepaid at Unli 1,090 is only 26,160.

So it is clearly cheaper to go with 5G Wifi Prepaid versus Postpaid. More importantly, it does not lock you in any contract.
