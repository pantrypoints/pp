[Co-founder Lam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baolamnguyen) has decided to step away from her operational role at Pantrypoints and Superphysics to pursue a full-time managerial opportunity at Vietnam Post Logistics.

<!-- She will still assist in the future development of Pantrypoints World. -->

Lam has been with us from 2017, financially and materially supporting our office, servers, domain, etc. Without her, Pantrypoints would not have survived beyond 2019. 

While we will deeply miss her energy and dedication, we fully support her journey and remain deeply grateful for the incredible foundation she helped build.

We’re adjusting quickly to ensure continuity in development:
- *Anh* will lead content and marketing efforts.
- *Nhien* will support key operational tasks.

Throughout Q1 2026, we will be reorganizing with the support of our partners to unify Pantrypoints and Superphysics.

As such, we begin 2026 with a new AI generated video reflecting the recent changes. 

<!-- (We started making AI Videos after AI became better with Nano Banana.)  -->
