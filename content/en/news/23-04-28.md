Diet-Disease Reference is a food reference app that promotes the use of food for medicine and nutrition, as 'nutraceuticals'. 

It aims to drive demand for a planetary health diet which is composed mostly of plant-based food. Our main innovations are:
- the linking of diseases to nutrients and to the food that has them 
- the use of machine learning to make adding content faster

The linking of diseases to nutrients uses the paradigm of alternative medicine, namely:

- Ayurveda
- Chinese medicine
- Naturopathy
- Traditional Philippine medicine


Here is a good educational material on the reality of ideas so you won't be ignorant anymore. 4:30 explains pre-existence and links it to past lives which are necessarily also real.
