Pantrypoints was at the Makati Rotary Club to be part of the Hatch Project.


The Hatch Project is an incubation program by Makati Rotary Club and Startup Village. 

The main difference between the Hatch Project and other programs is that it focuses on impact, something that Pantrypoints is good at, whether local or scalable. Most of the participants were social enterprises and not scalable tech startups. 

Among the topics discussed by Carlo Calimon of Startup Village today were the classic product-market fit and what makes a certain startup different from traditional businesses.

We had a business role playing game wherein the partcipants were split into groups acting as real businesses. 

The facilitator then simulated actual investment, production, and expense-accounting to see which group could produce the most revenue.
