We welcome VGE into the Pantrypoints system.

{{< img src="/graphics/vge.jpg" alt="VGE logo"  >}}

VGE stands for Venezuela Gente Excelente, a socio-civic group that aims for a prosperous Venezuela by lobbying peacefully against the oppressive policies of the Maduro regime. 

They will test our points-based system in a small part of their 23 hectare farm in Venezuela in 2024 after we finish our testing in the Philippines.
