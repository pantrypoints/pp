We began Pantrypoints in 2016 as a web-based app hosted in the cloud. 

We found that it wasn't so sustainable in terms of costs, since some cloud providers are expensive.

That's why we created a version of Pantrypoints for:
- self-hosting on an intranet, and
- offline through points cards

Last year, we tested self-hosted on the internet using Cloudflare Tunnel.

This gives us 4 options to deploy Pantrypoints for our partners:

1. Internet through the Cloud
2. Internet through Self-hosting
3. Intranet through Self-hosting
4. Offline through Points Cards
