Jose pitched the Oil of Hope (OOH) at QBO for the Accelerating Asia event as he tries to get support for his idea.

Oil of Hope is a new brand that makes coconut and cinnamon oils for massage, packaged by disabled people.

[Accelerating Asia](http://www.acceleratingasia.com) is a startup accelerator based in Singapore.

Jose didn't get support. However, he did get AWS credits which he shared with our developer team.
