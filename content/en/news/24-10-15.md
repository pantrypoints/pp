We are switching Pantrypoints Circle to Sveltekit in preparation for our implementation with Unlad Saka.

{{< i s="/graphics/svelte.jpg" a="Sveltekit" >}}


We began with Flask in 2011 and then changed to the following tech stacks:

Year | Stack or Framework
--- | ---
2011 | Python Flask
2013 | changed to Groovy Grails
2015 | changed to Ruby Sinatra
2016 | changed to Ruby on Rails
2017 | React Native
2019 | changed React Native to Flutter 
2020 | changed Rails to Elixir Phoenix
2024 | changed Phoenix to Sveltekit. ISAIAH switches from Flask to Streamlit


As a tech startup, we have to use the latest and most efficient web technologies that are scalable and performant, yet low cost in order to be sustainable. 

We tried out Solid JS, Qwik, and the BETH stack but Sveltekit was the most mature. 

Svelte 5 came out but we decided to stick with Svelte 4 for simplicity and maintainability, just as we use Flutter GetX for simplicity.
