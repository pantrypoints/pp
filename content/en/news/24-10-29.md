We joined the KMC SaaS Hackathon as Team Superphysics to push ISAIAH Match.

Our solution was not really SaaS so we didn't make it to the Top 10. 

However, we were able to get Match service running which could be used by the Pantrypoints apps. It profiles people based on palm prints and was pitched previously during the PNP hackathon. 


### XTech

The event happened at the same time as our pitch to Bayan Foundation where we got the idea to use the words "Exchange" instead of "Barter" so as to lead to "Xtech" or exchange technology, as opposed to fintech or financial technology.

Xtech implementats the ledger of barter-credits as the economic version of [Cartesian Relationality](https://superphysics.org/material/principles/intro/chapter-09) which is a fundamental concept in Superphysics.

We also clarified that the Circular Economy is within the Usufruct Economy which is opposed to the Selfish Economy espoused by Modern Economics. 
- The Usufruct Economy is based on Relationality, taking account the nature of the society-organism
- The Selfish Economy is based on selfishness, seeing entities in isolation instead of holistically
