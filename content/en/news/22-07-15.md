We welcome more partners implementing our moneyless points system:


## Food Rescue Philippines

[Food Rescue Philippines](https://foodrescueph.site) is a volunteer group that uses food waste to end malnutrition and involuntary hunger in the Philippines.

## Savilas Vietnam

Savilas is a small seafood company that sources its supplies from sustainable fisheries in Vietnam. We got in touch with them while we were adapting the Pantrypoints system for the Fishackathon challenge earlier this year.
