The recent community pantry phenomenon has inspired us to overhaul 'SORA' into 'Pantrypoints Economy-as-a-Service (EaaS)' to emphasize the decentralized and hyperlocal nature of our proposed economic system.  

<!-- We've decided to split SORA City into 'Hub' and 'Pantry' as part of the overhaul. The system now has 4 parts: 
1. Pantry
2. Hub
3. World
4. ISAIAH -->

SORA will now be EaaS which is split into 3 independent parts: 
1. Pantrypoints
2. Pantrypreneur
3. ISAIAH

Those parts will have the SORA features :

Old | New
--- | ---
SORA Govern or City | Pantrypoints City
SORA Trade | Pantrypoints World
SORA Health | Pantrypoints Health
SORA Agreeculture | Pantrypreneur Farm
SORA Apprentice | Pantrypoints Educate
SORA Reuse and SORA Relief | Pantrypoints Circle
SORA Beacon | Pantrypoints Build

We entered Pantrypoints Circle in the 3R Plastics Hackathon of the [UN-Habitat in the Philippines](http://unhabitat.org.ph) and made it to the preliminary round, but didn't make it to the Top 10. This is similar to us not making it to the Top 10 of the Pasig Climathon in 2019.
