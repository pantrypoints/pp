## Update

We didn't make it to the Top 10. Some of the top teams were:


1. Team Xcalp Webmint
2. FRM Coin 
3. Team Dvcode Sheesh! 
4. Team Life


We learned that:
- the play-to-earn model does not work for the app maker because there must be another source of revenue like ads, subscription, esports
- crypto founders are totally averse to having a physical thing as basis for their coins. This means that the current ethos of crypto is arbitrage instead of facilitating transactions or ciruclating goods and services
