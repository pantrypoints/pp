Juan and Jose attended the International Design Conference sub-event at the Yuchengco Museum last October 12 and got feedback from design experts on our apps and offline pointcards.

This led to design changes such as choosing Sveltekit and making changes to the layout of the pointcards.

This adds the following changes:

Addition | Purpose
--- | ---
Signature | This allows KYC by the points-banker
Contact details | This is for the other party
Avatar | This is available only for premade cards and is both for the other party and the points-banker
