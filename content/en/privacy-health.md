Effective Date: November 1, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Pantrypoints Health (the "App") manages information.

We take your privacy very seriously, and because this App is designed to operate entirely offline, our policy is extremely simple.

1. Our Core Privacy Promise: No Data Transmission

The fundamental principle of this App is that it is a stand-alone, offline reference tool for poor people who have no access to the internet or medical services.

The App does not connect to the internet, nor does it contain any networking code or features to transmit data.

This means that we, the developers, have no ability to collect, store, transmit, or process any information from your use of the App.

2. Information We DO NOT Collect

Due to the App’s offline nature and absence of internet connectivity, the following types of data are never collected, tracked, or transmitted to us or any third party:

Personal Information: We do not collect names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or any other identifying information.

Health and Medical Data: We do not collect, store, or process any diagnostic information, symptoms, search queries related to diseases, or other health data entered into or viewed within the App.

Usage Data/Analytics: We do not track how often you use the App, which pages you view, or any technical information about your device (such as IP address, operating system, or device ID).

Location Data: We do not access or track your geographic location.

<!-- 3. Local Data Storage (Information Stored ONLY on Your Device)

The App may store small amounts of non-personal information directly on your local device to enable core features, such as:

Favorites or Bookmarks: Storing a list of diseases or topics you have marked as favorites.

User Preferences: Saving settings like font size or theme.

This data is stored exclusively in the App's storage space on your mobile device. It is never sent to our servers, and we have no access to it. If you delete the App, this local data will also be deleted from your device. -->

3. Third-Party Services

The App is designed to be self-contained and does not use third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or other external services that require an internet connection.

4. Children’s Privacy

Because we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe the App has inadvertently collected any personal data (which is impossible under its current design), please contact us immediately.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the App is offline, we will notify users of any material changes by updating the policy within the App store description or publishing a new version of the App. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.

6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at pantrypoints@gmail.com

By using this App, you confirm that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
